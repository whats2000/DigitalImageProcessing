# Digital Image Processing

This repository contains a series of assignments for a digital image processing course. Each assignment is designed as a standalone GUI application, allowing users to interactively manipulate and transform images.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate various digital image processing techniques through hands-on applications. Users can perform operations such as filtering, edge detection, and color manipulation using the provided GUI interfaces.

## Assignment Structure

- **Homework 1**: This assignment focuses on basic image processing operations, such as image loading, resizing, histogram equalization, and grayscale slicing.
- **Homework 2**: This assignment introduces more advanced image processing techniques, including noise reduction, forier transform, and edge detection.
- **Homework 3**: This assignment explores color image processing, to further enhance the understanding of digital image processing techniques.

## Installation and Setup

To run the applications, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DigitalImageProcessing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DigitalImageProcessing
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   cd Homework1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each homework folder contains a GUI application. To start an application, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the main script:

```bash
cd Homework1
python hw1.py
```
